# sei-memory-game

This is the culmination of the pre course work for General Assembly's Software Engineer Intensive program (sei) program. I've not had any experience with JavaScript beforehand, so although it isn't perfect, I'm proud of it.

Hopefully once I've completed this course I can do such a game without any direction or guidance, preferably with my eyes closed (so to speak ... (type?)).
